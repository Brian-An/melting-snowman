## Melting Snowman Game

A fun twist on the classic Hangman game â€” instead of a stick figure, a snowman represents the player, slowly melting with each incorrect guess! Players can choose from three different categories, each containing six words to guess. For every wrong answer, a part of the snowman melts. If the snowman fully melts, the game ends.
