## Melting Snowman Game

A fun twist on the classic Hangman game â€” instead of a stick figure, a snowman represents the player, slowly melting with each incorrect guess! Players can choose from three different categories, each containing six words to guess. For every wrong answer, a part of the snowman melts. If the snowman fully melts, the game ends.

To run the Melting Snowman Game, you will need to install the `pygame` library. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
pip install pygame
python melting_snowman_game.py
```

This will start the game and you can enjoy playing the Melting Snowman Game!
